    configuration data from the JSS and serves as a container for
    objects representing the configured distribution points.

    This class provides an abstract interface for uploading packages and
    dmg's to file repositories.

    PLEASE NOTE: Not all DistributionPoint types support all of the
    available methods, or in the same way. For example, JDS' has
    caveats to the reliability of the exists() method.

    Support for AFP/SMB shares and JDS' are included, and are selected
    based on configuration files. Planned support for HTTP(S) and CDP
    types will come later.

    This object can copy files to multiple repositories, avoiding the
    need to use Casper Admin to "Replicate" from one repository to
    another, as long as the repositories are all configured correctly.

    See the individual Repository subclasses for information regarding
    type-specific properties and configuration.
